# ART 387: Impossible Architecture - (un)Realized Structure 5

* Point value: 100 pts.
* Due: Various

To this point, you've been designing structures with clear affinity and intent. (un)Realized Structure 5 challenges this sensibility, taking us out of our model of "idealization," reconciling real-world building demands against our often hopeful, imaginative nature. This assignment asks you to confront the often contrary requests made of architects in designing work that has social, environmental, or physical costs.

This project allows you to choose from a list of structure types which run contrary to your manifestos; however, your task is to determine some way to complete the structure that is consonant (i.e. in harmony with) the claims that your manifesto makes. The categories of structure or site to which you must respond (choose 1 from the following list):

* Prisons/correctional facility
* An abandoned gas station/brownsite
* Big-box retail (e.g. a Walmart or other comparable "temporary" architecture)

While this exercise may seem dour or antagonistic, I encourage you to think about ways in which your manifestos might rethink or challenge these structures and how design might encourage hopefulness in remaking our world.

## Guidelines

### Writing

This document should be placed in the `writing` directory of this assignment.
    
#### Proposal

* Due: 27 April 2020

The proposal document should have three parts:

##### Summary

A 100-150 word of the building type, rational for choice, and brief plan of how your work will respond to or challenge the category chosen. This summar should include a prospective project name which embodies the overall gestalt/intent of your work.

##### Guiding principles 

A list of design priorities and architectural "rules" which govern the creation of your structural model.

##### Rationale

A 200-250 word rationalization (using supplemental readings located in the `Readings` directory, or other background reading) which takes into account your personal manifesto and brief shallow research. The Rationale section must describe how your response or challenge will take physical shape in your model and arguments which your model addresses.

#### Structure

* Due: 1 May 2020

This should be a realization of your structural plan.
    
#### Documentation

- [ ] A completed proposal
- [ ] At least three (3) photos of the work uploaded to the `studies` directory

#### Label

- [ ] A label containing:
    * title of the structure
    * measurement of physical area taken up by the structure
    * materials used
    * your name

#### Nota bene

Keep in mind that all documentation (including, but not limited to the label) is potentially a part of the finished product. While not part of this project's evaluation, think of these materials as an opportunity to create an architectural design identity.

### Submitting the assignment

#### Final realized structure

* Materials must be turned in using the GitHub repository under which this project was assigned.
* Pictures must be placed in the `studies` directory of the repository

## Evaluation

This project will be evaluated based on:

- [ ] Completeness, taken to mean:
  * A structure is completed using the guidelines provided
- [ ] Insightful use writing to inform the design/viewer
- [ ] Documentation of process
